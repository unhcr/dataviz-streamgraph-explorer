# streamgraph-explorer

An interactive visualization system for exploring flow timeseries data (work in progress).

## Development

This project uses NPM and Webpack. To get started, clone the repository and install dependencies like this:

```
cd streamgraph-explorer
npm install
```

You'll need to build the JavaScript bundle using WebPack, using this command:

```
npm run build
```

To see the page run, you'll need to serve the site using a local HTTP server.

```
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```

Now the site should be available at localhost:8080.
